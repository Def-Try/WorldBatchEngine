                                               1.Introduction

Hi. I'm glad YOU're using my game engine. 
I hope you will read this file completely. 
I just want to make creating games on Batch easier. 
Good luck in creating your projects.










                                               2.Sprites

Start with a typing a simple sprite.

COMMANDS: cd %WBEnginePath(\data\)%
	  cd sprtest
	  call test.bat

Now you called a "summon" command and typed a simple sprite.
Why a .spr? Because I want the sprite extension to be .spr

Lets a create your own sprite!

			2.1.Creating your own sprites for WB Engine

Create a file with extension .spr

Example: MySprite.spr

Open this file using any text editor(such as Notepad) and create your own sprite from the characters on your keyboard.

Done! Save a file.

			2.2.Typing sprites

Output this sprite! To do this, use the "call summon.bat %pathToSprite%" command.

Done! You seeing a your sprate in command prompt.









                                               3.Music and sounds

PLay a "Powerup.wav" sound with a "sound.vbs" file.

COMMANDS: cd %WBEnginePath(\data\)%
	  cd sndtest
	  call sound.bat

Ok. Sounds not fully working on batch. I am for playing sound using VisualBasicScript file(VBS).

To play the sound, call "sound.vbs" with the name of the sound. For example: "call sound.vbs music.wav"







                                               4.Controls


                         4.1.Simple controls

There is nothing complicated about creating a simple control.

COMMANDS:call scontrolcreate.bat createset %var%
It command created User input.

Create output!

COMMANDS:call scontrolcreate.bat createif %var% %key% %to%

This command created a condition. If a person enters the word specified in %key%, program is go to %to%


                         4.2.A "W,A,S,D" controls

Call a wasdcontrols.bat wherever you need WASD character control

It is returns a value in %errorlevel% from 1 to 5, depending on the key being pressed. 5 returns when the player did not click anything

1 - W
2 - A
3 - S
4 - D




                                               5.Saves and game data

                         5.1.Save code

Save code is a veeeery simple

I just don't make file to save-load code.

COMMANDS: 

#generate
echo Save Code: %var1%%var2%

#to load
set /p save=Save Code:
if %save%==00 (commands)
if %save%==01 (commands)
if %save%==11 (commands)
